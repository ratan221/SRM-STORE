# SRM STORE

SRM STORE is a simple e-commerce web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **LocalStorage**. This project allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and manage their orders. The application also uses LocalStorage to save cart data locally, so users can retain their cart contents even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Product Display**: View a list of products with product details and images.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and modify items in the cart. Cart data is saved locally using LocalStorage.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive design that works across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Order Management**: Complete your order and see the items added to the cart.
- **Search & Filter**: Search for products and filter by category (if applicable).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for persisting the shopping cart data
